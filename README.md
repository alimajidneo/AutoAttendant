# DeskRoute

**Current development:** receptionist for USA customer handover using Supabase PostgreSQL, Supabase Auth, and LiveKit, with browser testing as the first milestone. Start with [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md), [setup](docs/SETUP.md), and [decisions](docs/DECISIONS.md). Onboarding no longer requires a phone purchase. The upstream phone capabilities described below remain available for a later milestone.

An AI receptionist for appointment-based local businesses. Customers call a real US phone number - DeskRoute answers, books appointments via Google Calendar, and escalates anything it can't handle to the business owner through an admin dashboard.

Self-hosted and open source. One deployment runs one or more agents.

**[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** describes the whole system: layout, the call path, the schema, the design system, and the reasoning behind every rule.

## Features

- **Real phone calls** - LiveKit Phone Numbers, no SIP trunk setup required
- **Answers from context** - services, pricing, business details *and the whole knowledge base* baked into the system prompt at call start, so no tool call and no retrieval round trip
- **Knowledge base** - question/answer pairs built from resolved escalations, inlined into the prompt at call start
- **Real opening hours** - a weekly pattern with lunch closures, days you're shut, and one-off dates for holidays. Your agent answers "are you open Saturday?" without asking you
- **Services with real durations** - each one has its own length, plus optional setup and cleanup time that blocks your calendar without the caller ever hearing about it
- **Appointment booking that respects both** - the agent only offers times you're actually open, long enough for the service booked, and free on your calendar. It re-checks the moment before it books, so a slot taken mid-conversation doesn't become a double booking
- **AI disclosure on every call** - callers are told they're speaking to an AI before anything else is said. Required by law in several US states, and not editable by the business
- **Recording is the business's choice** - turn it off, or leave the `R2_*` variables unset, and nothing is stored. The disclosure stops claiming otherwise either way, and each call records which wording it played
- **Bookings have a name on them** - the agent asks who is coming *when it books*, never while you're just asking a question. The name lands on the calendar entry, the appointment, and the caller's record for next time
- **Escalation loop** - unanswerable questions flagged for admin review; resolved answers auto-populate the knowledge base
- **Call recordings** - recorded calls get audio alongside the full transcript and AI-generated summary; transcript and summary are kept either way
- **In-browser agent test** - talk to your agent live from the dashboard, no phone call. Nothing is recorded and no call is logged, but booking is real: a test session writes a genuine appointment and calendar event
- **Admin dashboard** - the call log, a queue for answering escalations, a day-by-day view of what is booked, the knowledge base, and settings
- **More than one agent per install** - every table is agent-scoped, so a second business, a second location or a second line is another row rather than another deployment


## How It Works

1. Customer calls the business's US phone number
2. LiveKit routes the call to the AI agent worker via SIP
3. The dialled number is matched against `phone_numbers` to pick which agent answers. That agent builds a system prompt from its business context and speaks - the AI disclosure first, mentioning recording only when recording is on, then the business's own greeting
4. STT → LLM → TTS pipeline handles the conversation; the audio turn detector decides when the caller has finished
5. Pricing, opening hours and knowledge-base answers come straight from the system prompt - no tool calls needed
6. Genuinely unknown questions are flagged for admin review
7. Bookings: the agent asks what service and roughly when, the backend works out which slots actually exist from your hours and that service's length, and reads back two or three. The caller picks one, the agent takes their name, and it's confirmed into your calendar
8. On hang-up: transcript extracted, summary generated, call record finalized

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io) project with a US phone number purchased and a SIP dispatch rule configured
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project with Google sign-in enabled; follow [setup](docs/SETUP.md)
- [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) bucket, only if you want call recordings
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key, only when `LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter`
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for the development and test databases

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrabhatMattoo/DeskRoute.git
cd DeskRoute
pnpm install
```

A pnpm workspace. `apps/api`, `apps/voice` and `apps/web` are the three processes; `packages/core` holds the database, repositories, providers and domain logic they share; `packages/shared` holds the types the browser needs too.

### Environment

Each package owns the variables it reads, and every one ships an `.env.example` beside it. Copy each to `.env` and fill it in.

**`apps/api/.env`** and **`apps/voice/.env`** share the first block:

```env
DATABASE_URL=                  # postgresql://deskroute:deskroute@localhost:5432/deskroute
LIVEKIT_URL=                   # wss://your-project.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=

# Recording storage. Set all four, or none to run without recording.
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
R2_BUCKET_NAME=
```

**`apps/api/.env`** adds:

```env
PORT=8080
DASHBOARD_ORIGINS=             # comma-separated; defaults to http://localhost:5173
PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080 # public API origin used by Google Calendar OAuth
                               # any localhost port is accepted when a localhost origin is listed
```

**`apps/voice/.env`** adds:

```env
LLM_PROVIDER=                  # "livekit" (default) or "openrouter"
LLM_MODEL=                     # id in the selected provider's format, e.g. google/gemini-3.5-flash
SUMMARY_LLM_MODEL=             # model for post-call summaries (can match LLM_MODEL)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=            # required when LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=           # https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

**`packages/core/.env`** holds `DATABASE_URL` alone, for `drizzle-kit`.

**`apps/web/.env.local`**
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

### Database

```bash
pnpm db:generate   # generate a migration from schema changes
pnpm db:migrate    # apply to the database in DATABASE_URL
```

The chain runs against any empty Postgres, and `packages/core/tests/migrations.int.test.ts` proves it on a throwaway database.

### Tests

```bash
docker compose up -d   # dev Postgres on 5432, throwaway test Postgres on 5433
pnpm test              # unit + agent tests (no DB, no network)
pnpm test:int          # repository tests against the test Postgres
pnpm test:live         # real Google Calendar; needs apps/voice/.env
pnpm test:web          # the design-token contract
pnpm typecheck         # tsc --noEmit across every package
```

`test:live` is the only suite that runs against real credentials. It reads the development database to find an agent with a connected calendar, gets that agent's Google token the same way a live call does, and books and cancels one clearly-labelled event to prove the padded block is actually reserved — because if an event covers only the appointment and not its buffers, freeBusy reports the setup and cleanup free and the next caller is offered them. It writes nothing to the database, and skips with a reason if no calendar is connected. Point it at a specific agent with `LIVE_AGENT_ID`.

The web suite is the colour contract rather than component tests. One surface is given, the stage, and every other colour is a departure from it, so the suite asserts *relationships* rather than values: the anchor holds still as contrast moves, surfaces and controls travel in opposite directions, ink mixes toward the pole instead of stepping a fixed distance, chroma moves in proportion to lightness, no line is ever lighter than what it edges, every overlay carries an edge, nothing anywhere is smaller than 14px, and every pair clears its floor **on the ground it actually lands on**.

Break a law in `index.css` and the suite goes red. That is the point of it.

### Run

```bash
pnpm dev            # runs all three below at once via concurrently

# …or run them in separate terminals:
pnpm dev:api        # API server → http://localhost:8080
pnpm dev:voice      # LiveKit worker - keep running alongside the API
pnpm dev:web        # Admin dashboard → http://localhost:5173
```
